## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Document Structure**: Follow the established document structure for consistency. Each document should focus on a single core concept or question.
2. **File Naming**: Use the format `topic-subtopic-shortslug.md` for file names, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.
3. **Metadata**: Include YAML front matter in all major documents to provide context and facilitate AI interactions.
4. **Version Control**: Maintain a changelog for significant structural changes or concept rewrites.
5. **Experiment Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose, methodology, results, and interpretations of experiments conducted.

## AI Interaction

When interacting with AI tools, provide clear prompts that reference the project structure and metadata rules. This will help in generating relevant and accurate responses.

## Future Improvements

This README will be updated as the project evolves. Suggestions for improvements or additional guidelines are welcome and can be discussed in the project's communication channels.
